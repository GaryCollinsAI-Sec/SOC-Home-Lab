# SOC-Home Lab

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
To secure the environment, I performed a comprehensive hardening of the AlmaLinux SOC station by implementing the principle of least privilege, disabling unnecessary services, and configuring a strict firewall (firewalld) policy. I further enhanced the system's resilience by deploying SSH key-based authentication, enabling SELinux in enforcing mode, and applying kernel-level optimizations to ensure a stable, defensible platform for running OpenVAS scans against OWASP Juice Shop. This hardened baseline ensures that all threat hunting activities and scheduled vulnerability assessments are conducted from a trusted, tamper-resistant vantage point.
